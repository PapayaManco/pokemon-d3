# pokemon-d3
A project I made for a class using d3.js with the pokemon database, you can see all the pokemon with some variants, you can filter them by gen or type, and see how i made it work!

# How to use it

in the folder cmd use ```python -m http.server``` and open the EX.html


Pokemon database is from: https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420">Kaggle
